For more details on the data see [this page](http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/GTM/3PhaseData.html).\r\n\r\nWe first consider the performance of the algorithm at relatively low numbers of data points, taking 100 points from the full data set.\r\n\r\n#### Mixtures of Principal Coordinate Analysers\r\n\r\nThe first example is run using `demOil1001.m`. It is a mixture of principal coordinate analysers (i.e. a mixture of GP-LVMs with linear kernels) using a gating network in the latent space. The model is initialised with 20 components. The results are shown in the figure below.\r\n\r\n![](demOil1001.png)![](demOil1001Cluster.png)\r\n\r\n*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the reduced oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demOil1001`) and **Right**: the assignments of the points to clusters.*\r\n\r\n![](demOil1002.png)![](demOil1002Cluster.png)\r\n*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the reduced oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demOil1001`) and **Right**: the RBF kernel (`demOil1002`).*\r\n\r\nThe second example replaces the linear kernels with radial basis function kernels. This can be run using `demOil1002.m`.\r\n\r\n#### Full Oil Data\r\n\r\n![](demOil1.png)![](demOil1Cluster.png)\r\n\r\n*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the full oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demOil1`) (10 initial components) and **Right** the assignment of points to components.*\r\n\r\n![](demOil2.png)![](demOil2Cluster.png)\r\n\r\n*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the full oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demOil2`) (20 initial components) and **Right** the assignment of points to components.*\r\n\r\n![](demOil3.png)![](demOil3Cluster.png)\r\n\r\n*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the full oil data using **Left**: RBF kernels, `demOil3`) (5 initial components) and **Right** the assignment of points to components.*\r\n\r\n#### Stick Man Data\r\n\r\n![](demStick1.png)![](demStick1Cluster.png)\r\n\r\n*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the full oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demStick1`) (10 initial components) and **Right** the assignment of points to components.*\r\n\r\n![](demStick2.png)![](demStick2Cluster.png)\r\n\r\n* Mixtures of GP-LVM on the full oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demStick2`) (20 initial components) and **Right** the assignment of points to components.*\r\n\r\nPage updated on Tue Mar 19 11:40:37 2013\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
