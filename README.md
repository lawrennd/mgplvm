This release was triggered by several requests and intereactions concerning mixtures of GP-LVMs.

### Version 0.11

This was the second release and was associated with an ICML 2008 submission.

### Version 0.1

This is the first release and was associated with a 2007 NIPS Submission.

### Oil Data

The 'oil data' is commonly used as a bench mark for visualisation algorithms. For more details on the data see [this page](http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/GTM/3PhaseData.html).

We first consider the performance of the algorithm at relatively low numbers of data points, taking 100 points from the full data set.

#### Mixtures of Principal Coordinate Analysers

The first example is run using `demOil1001.m`. It is a mixture of principal coordinate analysers (i.e. a mixture of GP-LVMs with linear kernels) using a gating network in the latent space. The model is initialised with 20 components. The results are shown in the figure below.

*Mixtures of GP-LVM on the reduced oil data using **Left**: linear kernels (Principal Coordinate Analysis, `demOil1001`) and **Right**: the RBF kernel (`demOil1002`).*

The second example replaces the linear kernels with radial basis function kernels. This can be run using `demOil1002.m`.
